## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

## Readme:

*** Inspiration ***
Before this project began, some friends showed me a game called 'Balotro', which applies rougelike elements to the card game Poker; the concept, I thought, was really weird and funny. Then this project started, and it was about randomly generated faces. The immediate inspiration came from the Mac computer's Finder icon - two colours separated by a line down the middle, which had a dent in the middle to create a nose. 

From this, I thought of tiling multiple of these faces together, which lead to the idea of jigsaw pieces interacting with their immediate neighbours to produce different outcomes. I also thought, instead of having one face split in two, separated by line and colour, I instead have two faces occupying the same piece. 

Finally it came down to the method of randomisation. Being shown a pack of cards in lecture and with Balotro's concept still fresh in my mind, I decided to make a randomisation algorithm based on a simpler casino game: Blackjack. The pieces would compete externally with other pieces and internally with its faces to determine certain features.

*** Randomisation ***
There are only three instances of randomisation used in the Board class: 
    pullRandom(...) will choose a random card from a deck and assign it to a competitor (player or dealer). The bound is locally defined in the method as:
        0 <= x < deck.length,
        where deck.length is the length of the deck and is discrete,
        where x is Math.floor(Math.random() * deck.length) and is discete

    coinflip() is a 50/50 chance to return true or false, and is used to make player competitors risk getting a higher score. The bound is locally defined in the method as:
        0 <= x < 1,
        where x is a random float and is continuous
    
    createJigsawPieces() uses random percentage chance to decide whether a piece is 'in place' or 'scattered', as well as providing a randomised position and rotation to that scattered piece. The bounds for these three properties is provided externally through the array VARIANCE, as:
        -NOTCH_LENGTH * 4 < x < NOTCH_LENGTH * 4,
        -NOTCH_LENGTH * 2 < y < NOTCH_LENGTH * 2,
        -180(d) < theta(d) < 180(d),
        where NOTCH_LENGTH == canvasHeight/50 and is continious,
        where x is a random float and is continious,
        where y is a random float and is continious,
        where theta is a random float and is continious

They all use Math.random() since it most closely aligns with the real world uniform distribution.

*** Application ***
pullRandom(...) and coinflip() contribute to giving competitors random cards, each with some value, which total up to some score. The goal is for one competitor to have the higher score than the other, but not to have one greater than 21, otherwise they lose. 

Players will compete with neighbouring dealers, and dealers will compete with neighbouring players to determine the notch direction and shape. 
    Depending on who has the bigger value for their first card (with the exception of players having equal score to their neighbour competitors, in this case the dealer wins), the notches will stick into the losers.

    Depending on the suit of each competitors first card, the winner of the the condition above will determine the shape of the notch.
        Spade creates trapezoid notches,
        Heart creates rounded notches,
        Club creates rectangular notches,
        Diamond greates triangular notches

The competitors inside of each jigsaw piece then compete internally in a game of Blackjack to determine facial features. 
    Depending on the outcomes (PUSH, BUST, WIN, LOSE, BLACKJACK, BLACKJACKLOSS), competitors would be assigned a mouth and eyes. 
        PUSH creates a neutral face for both competitors when both competitors have the same score,
        BUST creates a dead face when a competitor has a score greater than 21,
        WIN creates a happy face when a competitor beats its opponent through higher score or opponent bust,
        LOSE creates a sad face when a competitor loses to its opponent,
        BLACKJACK creates a very happy face when a competitor beats its opponent with an A card and a 10 value card,
        BLACKJACKLOSS creates an angry face when a competitor loses to its opponent, who has obtained Blackjack

        When it comes to PUSH and BLACKJACK outcomes, competitors are also assigned a different colour; grey and gold respectively.

    Depending on the first card in a competitors hand with a symbol (J, Q, K, A), if there is one, competitors are also assigned an accessory which renders above the face.
        J creates a star,
        Q creates a dagger,
        K creates a crown,
        A creates a spade

## Changelog:

14/04 
Began work on drawing each half piece.
The original plan was to have rounded notches, but it became far too complex for my brain to be bothered handling, so instead triangles will be used as the shape of the notch

15/04
Made the board and some comparison logic that determines which way the notches of each piece should be facing

16/04
Added some background details to make it look less bland. Also added scattering so the pieces can have a random location and rotation, making it look a little more interesting. Currently there is only random rotation. It is broken currently, however, as I also added a shadow which is currently rendering over itself. I will likely need to split the drawing method into multiple passes (shadow and layer in case they overlap).

The pieces are now able to tile properly at different angles. Tomorrow, I will try to make it so that when the pieces are scaled either vertically or horizontally, they stay connected. The scattering effect has been temporarily removed. 
The reason why I am going through all this effort is because I felt that just having a top down view of the pieces was kind of boring, and I want it to be possible to view them at different orthographic perspectives. The plan is to have them resting on a table as an incomplete puzzle, and also have a box in the background which has the complete set of pieces put together. Both the box and the puzzle pieces will show the faces (I will make these tomorrow).

17/04
The shadow is back, this time it renders correctly. The rest of the transformation code is complete; pieces now dislay appropriatly when scaled or rotated (this has the effect of the pieces appearing 3D, as there is a way to "change" perspective). As the blackjack code has not been finished, there is currently a very primitive competing code where the player and dealer simply compare their hands to see which one is bigger. Some primitive faces were added also, one for winning and losing.

18/04
Added new mouth type shock, which happens when a competitor goes bust. X eyes still need to be added for this game outcome. A simple AI representing the player's moves have been added, as well as multiple end game states (WIN, LOSE, BUST, DRAW, BLACKJACK). The colours have also been updated; red is the player and black is the dealer. Some temporary colours have been added for the DRAW state (grey) and the BLACKJACK state (gold). 

19/04
Made a series of new faces and eyes: neutral face, angry, dead and blackjack eyes. More details need to be added to the face based on the suits of each competitors cards, and maybe even what symbols the cards are. I'm thinking of suits being different notch shapes, however, this may take tweaking existing elements of my code.

20/4
Added new eye expression for "LOSE", which occurs whenever a competitor has lost but not to blackjack or bust.
Began working on different notches based on the suit of the competitors first card. So far "spade", "club", and "diamond" have unique notches; point, square, and trapezoid respectivly. I have also begun working on the arrangement of the pieces. The scattering has also returned, allowing for a percentage chance of a piece being 'scattered' as opposed to in place. 

23/4
Made the last notch shape for "heart" suit, a semi rounded notch (I couldn't be bothered making it a complete circle). I have also made it so the editor now can display these alternate notches.

24/04
Began working on the table. Only some simple colours exist so far. Later on I will add a box for the puzzle pieces, or maybe a deck of cards. I want to try to make a gradient across the table. I plan on making accessories for each face if they have a king, queen, jack, or ace in their hand.

26/04
Began reworking the shadows cast by the pieces to make them look more realistic, because currently they are not. A box meant to be the container for the pieces have been added, although the shadow is too a bit broken. Tomorrow will be spent fixing these issues as well as implement one final thing; a new class called Accessories. This will give some additional details to competitors with JQKA cards in their hands, as well as add a logo to the box.

27/04
I have changed my mind. Realistic shadows that connect to certain points of the pieces turns out to be far too complex for me to be bothered dealing with given the time frame. Instead, a closer, darker shadow is also rendered. There is also a slight highlight outline being rendered as well. Added a new accessory that is drawn on any competitor that has an ace in their hand.

29/04
Made new accessory for king: crown. These new accessories are given based on which card a competitor held first, e.g. if a competitor has both a king and a queen, but recieved the king card first, then it will have a king accessory. The box also now has an accessory. Its shape and colour is determined by the most occuring symbol out of J Q K and Blackjack, and its colour is determined by the most occuring suit.

30/04
Added the last two accessories for J Q: star and dagger respectively. Added comments.

01/05
Added readme and made it so pullRandom(...) method in Board class can exclude certain cards from being pulled, as if they have been removed from the deck.

02/05
Updated sketch.jpg, preview.jpg, abd thumbnail.png. Updated readme.
